# Linklyst Project Guidelines

## Project Overview
**Objective**: Develop *Linklyst*, an enhanced link management platform tailored for content creators (e.g., OnlyFans, Inflow), focusing on anti-ban protection, personalized landing pages, advanced analytics, and secure collaboration.

**Target Audience**: Content creators, influencers, agencies, and their teams.

**Core Goals**:
- Provide secure, ban-resistant link redirection to protect against platform restrictions (e.g., Instagram, Twitter).
- Enable customizable, responsive landing pages for bio links (similar to Beacons/Linktree).
- Offer detailed analytics and integration with platforms like OnlyFans/Inflow.
- Support collaborative workflows for agencies and teams.

## Key Features and Requirements

### 1. Secure "Shield" Link Redirection (Anti-Ban)
**Purpose**: Protect links from being banned on social platforms by evading bot detection.

**Functionalities**:
- **Bot Detection**:
  - Analyze user-agent, IP, behavior (e.g., absence of referrer), and known bot patterns.
  - Maintain an updated blacklist of Instagram/Facebook bots.
- **Intelligent Redirection**:
  - Human users redirected to the target link (e.g., OnlyFans) if direct link is actived.
  - Bots redirected to a custom user landing page.
  - Optional: Add redirection delays or human interaction checks (e.g., CAPTCHA).
- **Customization**:
  - Allow users to set target and decoy (bot) links.
  - Configurable link expiration or rotation.
- **Analytics**:
  - Track bot detection rate, bot origins (IP, platform), and bot vs. human traffic comparison.
- **Advanced Protection (Optional)**:
  - Implement URL cloaking.
  - Generate temporary links with unique hashes.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Use server-side logic for bot detection (e.g., Node.js, Python).
- Store bot blacklist in a database (e.g., MongoDB) with regular updates via a cron job.
- Ensure low-latency redirection to maintain user experience.

### 2. Personalized Landing Pages
**Purpose**: Enable users to create branded, mobile-optimized landing pages for bio links.

**Functionalities**:
- **Visual Editor**:
  - Drag-and-drop interface for adding blocks (links, text, images, videos, buttons).
  - Real-time preview (mobile and desktop).
- **Templates**:
  - Simple bio page, product page, link hub, and agency multi-link models contain all model social link  like https://link.me/alinarose for exemple.
- **Analytics**:
  - Track clicks per link/section, device, and source (with UTM/referrer support).
- **Domain Customization**:
  - Default: `linklyst.com/username`.
  - Premium: Custom domains (e.g., `yourname.com`).
- **Performance**:
  - Optimize for mobile browsers (Safari, Chrome).
  - Minimize load times with clean code and CDN usage.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Use a frontend framework (e.g., React) for the editor and preview.
- Store page configurations in a NoSQL database (e.g., Firebase).
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS or similar.

---

### 3. Custom Domain Support (Premium)
**Purpose**: Allow users to use personalized domains for branding.

**Functionalities**:
- Support custom domains (e.g., `yourname.com`) or purchase new ones via the platform.
- Automate DNS management (CNAME, SSL, redirects).
- Dynamic pricing based on TLD and domain availability.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Integrate with a domain registrar API (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy).
- Use Let’s Encrypt for automated SSL certificates.
- Provide a user-friendly DNS setup guide.

---

### 4. Advanced Analytics
**Purpose**: Provide actionable insights into link performance.

**Functionalities**:
- Track total clicks and clicks per link.
- Analyze geographic data (via IP).
- Identify device types (mobile/desktop, OS, browser).
- Support UTM/referrer tracking (optional).
- Generate heatmaps for click distribution.
- Filter data by date, source, or campaign.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Use a third-party analytics service (e.g., Google Analytics) or custom solution.
- Store raw data in a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB).
- Visualize data with charts (e.g., Chart.js).

---

### 5. API Integration with OnlyFans/Inflow
**Purpose**: Sync platform data for enhanced tracking.

**Functionalities**:
- OAuth or API key authentication.
- Sync subscriber count, revenue, and new subscribers per link.
- Display data in a unified dashboard.
- Support multiple accounts in one dashboard.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Verify API availability for OnlyFans/Inflow.
- Use secure OAuth flows and token storage.
- Handle rate limits and errors gracefully.

---

### 6. Collaborative Roles and Access Management
**Purpose**: Enable team workflows with granular permissions.

**Functionalities**:
- **Roles**:
  - Admin: Full access.
  - Manager: Edit links, create pages, view stats.
  - Assistant: Limited access to specific links/pages.
- Restrict actions (e.g., creation, deletion, revenue visibility).
- Assign permissions by link, model, or campaign.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with a user management system.
- Store permissions in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL).

---

### 7. Model/Campaign Management (Agency-Focused)
**Purpose**: Support agencies managing multiple creators or campaigns.

**Functionalities**:
- Create dedicated pages per link.
- Associate links with specific models.
- Filter analytics by model/campaign.
- Generate automated reports.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Use a hierarchical data structure for models and campaigns.
- Automate report generation with a template engine (e.g., Pug).

---

### 8. Advanced Interface Customization
**Purpose**: Provide a modern, user-friendly interface.

**Functionalities**:
- Responsive UI with dark/light modes.
- Drag-and-drop link editor.
- Customizable themes (fonts, colors, buttons).
- Real-time preview.
- Support HTML embeds (e.g., iframes, OnlyFans subscribe buttons).

**Technical Considerations**:
- Build with React and Tailwind CSS.
- Use a state management library (e.g., Redux) for real-time updates.
- Sanitize HTML embeds to prevent XSS attacks.

---

### 9. Bonus Features (V2)
**Purpose**: Enhance platform value with future updates.

**Functionalities**:
- QR code generation for links.
- A/B testing for landing pages.
- Auto-generate bio links from OnlyFans/Inflow profiles.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Prioritize low-effort, high-impact features (e.g., QR codes).
- Plan A/B testing with a split-testing framework.
